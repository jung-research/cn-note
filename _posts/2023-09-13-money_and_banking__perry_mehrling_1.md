## 0. Big Picture / Blue Print

基于作者(perry mehrling)的 monetary economics and financial econimics 思想史基础上, I(作者) locate myself in the distinctly
American tradition of monetary thought

how we understand money, banking, and central banking.

origins of monetary thought lie in concrete banking practice.

切入点,
    1. we start not so much with the 经济学工具[^1] (tools of economics),
    2. 而是(but rather with), the testimony of practical bankers themselves(实践的银行家自身),
    3. whose business requires them to work out the implications of a changing world for their own practice(对变化的世界的理解).
    4. write down what they know in the form of a manual to teach others(撰写成册, 教别人)

并不是以介绍经典案例, 理论, 方法论等, 而是倾听, 学习一线从业者(银行家)的著书, 整理归纳出一套属于自己(对 monetary economics)的理解

we will be listening to bankers, trying to build up our own sense of the system inductively.

(这个方式不是不好, 需要有足够的自信的教授, 才会有底气这个干...)

The analytical backbone of the course is an accounting model(会计模型), both micro and macro.

Q: What is a bank ?

  bank assets & liabilities

Four functions of banking

    1. Clearing
    2. market making
    3. advance clearing
    4. intermediation

Four prices of money

    1. Par             - diferent types of money(currency, deposists); 票面价值
    2. Interest        - future money(fed funds, Eurodollars, repo)
    3. Exchange rate   - foreign money
    4. Price level     - commodities
